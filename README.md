# SunSCREEN

The program included in the attached document is for the purpose of operating a SunSCREEN for the 2022 Annual UCLA IEEE IdeaHacks competition.
The project made it to the finals in judging but unfortunatley did not place.

*Our Inspiration* <br />
We live in a world where every second seems to be a new danger. Whether it's a pandemic, or simply exposure to too much nature, our lives have been in a constant state of change. That's why we invented SunSCREEN.

*What it Does* <br />
SunSCREEN utilizes a carefully integrated UV-light sensor to trace and alert SunSCREEN users of their exposure outside, and it does so in 3 simple steps, all distinguishable by our innovative and user friendly Stoplight alert system. We know technology can not be user-friendly, that's why here at SunSCREEN we made you the pilot of your own ship. Our innovative SunSCREEN module is ready-to-go out of the box and is capable of going anywhere, and can be worn by anyone. No user is too young or too old! Our innovative Stoplight alert system matches our daily driving routine: GREEN -- It's okay! Choose to reapply sunscreen if you would like, though it's safe if you choose not to! YELLOW -- It's a little sunny out today, be sure to apply sunscreen and reapply! RED -- Careful! It is highly recommended that you wear sunscreen! The area you are in has high levels of UV light!

See! Quick, easy, and familiar! We've even included an alert system for red scenarios! (And don't worry, if the alert is bothersome you can always switch it off!
